"""
Music Integration Instructions:

1. MUSIC FILE SETUP:
   - Save your ambient music as: docs/src/assets/mera_ambient_music.wav
   - Ensure file size is reasonable (< 20MB for WAV, < 10MB for MP3)
   - WAV provides higher quality, MP3 is more compressed
   
2. CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS:
   - Edit ambient_music_player.js to change music URL
   - Modify player appearance in the CSS section
   - Add multiple music tracks if desired
   
3. USER EXPERIENCE:
   - Music player appears as floating icon in bottom-right
   - Users can control play/pause/volume
   - Preferences are saved in browser localStorage
   - Works on desktop and mobile devices
   
4. ACCESSIBILITY:
   - Music is completely optional
   - No auto-play (user must click to start)
   - Volume controls and easy muting
   - Respects user's system dark/light theme
