# Flux Budgets (inflow / outflow)

[`fluxbudget`](@ref) measures the **flux of mass, momentum, energy and metals through a surface**
(a sphere at radius R, or a cylinder wall), with the surface-normal velocity split into separate
**inflow** and **outflow** rates — the thin-shell estimator that galactic-feedback and gas-cycle
studies otherwise hand-roll for every paper, here as a first-class, conservation-aware primitive.

The estimator is the standard shell sum: for a thin shell of width `Δr` straddling the surface at
radius R, the flux of a carried quantity `q` is `Φ = Σᵢ qᵢ·v⊥ᵢ / Δr`, with cells split by the sign of
the surface-normal velocity `v⊥` (`:vr_sphere` for a sphere, `:vr_cylinder` for a cylinder). For a thin
shell this approximates the surface integral `∮ q·v⊥ dA`. Everything is computed from `getvar` (with
correct per-level AMR cell volumes) and returned in physical rate units.

## Basic use

```julia
gas = gethydro(getinfo(output, path))

fb = fluxbudget(gas; surface=:sphere, radius=30.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc,
                quantities=[:mass, :momentum, :energy, :metals])

fb.rates.mass.out      # outflow rate          [Msol/yr]
fb.rates.mass.in       # inflow rate (≤ 0)     [Msol/yr]
fb.rates.mass.net      # net = in + out        [Msol/yr]
fb.rates.energy.net    # net energy flux       [erg/s]
```

Units per quantity: **mass** and **metals** in `Msol/yr`, **momentum** in `Msol·km/s/yr`, **energy** in
`erg/s`. `in` sums cells moving inward (`v⊥ < 0`), `out` those moving outward; `net = in + out`. For
mass/metals/energy `in ≤ 0` and `out ≥ 0`; for **momentum** the carried quantity already contains `v⊥`
(radial momentum), so both `in` and `out` are ≥ 0 — the ram-pressure flux from in- and out-moving gas.

!!! note "`:metals` needs a `:metallicity` column"
    The `:metals` flux multiplies cell mass by the gas metallicity, read from a column literally named
    `:metallicity`. Mera does **not** auto-treat a passive scalar (e.g. `:var6`) as metallicity, so on a
    run without that column `:metals` raises a clear error rather than silently returning zero — alias
    your metal scalar to `:metallicity` before the call if needed. Likewise `:energy` needs the thermal
    energy (pressure `:p`) and errors clearly on an isothermal/pressureless output.

!!! warning "Cosmological runs: no Hubble flow"
    `v⊥` is the **peculiar** gas velocity; the Hubble flow `H(a)·r` is not added. At large radius the
    Hubble term can dominate and even flip the inflow/outflow sign, so the in/out split near turnaround
    is unreliable on cosmological/zoom runs (a `@warn` fires). The non-cosmological case is unaffected.

Use `surface=:cylinder` for the flux through a cylindrical wall (e.g. the edge of a disk):

```julia
fc = fluxbudget(gas; surface=:cylinder, radius=15.0, shell_width=1.0, range_unit=:kpc)
```

## Choosing the shell width

The estimator assumes the shell is **filled** by cells (`Σm ≈ ρ·4πR²·Δr`), so `shell_width` must be
**at least the local cell size** — ideally a few cells. A shell *thinner than the AMR* is unphysical:
it still grabs whole cells (larger than the band) but divides by the too-small `Δr`, **over-counting**
the flux. `fluxbudget` records the shell's median `cell_size` and warns when `shell_width < cell_size`;
the result's `show` flags it `UNDER-RESOLVED`. Pick `Δr ≳ ` the local cell size (use
`getvar(fluxshell(...), :cellsize, :kpc)` to check) and confirm the rate is insensitive to a modest
change in `Δr`.

## How the flux is computed (a total, not a mean)

A rate is an **integrated total over the surface**, not an average of cell values. For every cell `i`
in the thin shell, the carried quantity `qᵢ` is multiplied by its surface-normal velocity `v⊥,ᵢ`, and
these are **summed** and divided by the shell width:

```text
flux  =  ( Σᵢ qᵢ · v⊥,ᵢ ) / Δr        # a sum over shell cells, then ÷ shell width
in    =  Σ over cells with v⊥ < 0       out = Σ over cells with v⊥ ≥ 0       net = in + out
```

This is the discrete form of the surface integral `∮ q v⊥ dA`: summing the cell contributions over the
shell *volume* and dividing by its thickness `Δr` recovers the *area* integral. So `Δr` is the
**integration thickness, not a smoothing scale** — the result is (by construction) ≈ independent of `Δr`
once `Δr ≳` a cell size; a wider shell just averages over more cells and so **lowers the sampling
error**, at the cost of radial localization. The carried quantity per cell is

| `quantity` | carried `qᵢ` | rate unit |
|---|---|---|
| `:mass`     | cell mass `mᵢ`              | M⊙/yr |
| `:metals`   | `mᵢ · Zᵢ` (metallicity)    | M⊙/yr |
| `:momentum` | `mᵢ · v⊥,ᵢ` (radial momentum) | M⊙·km/s/yr |
| `:energy`   | `E_kin,ᵢ + E_therm,ᵢ`      | erg/s |

There is **no** built-in mean/median/percentile reduction of the budget itself — it is a sum, because a
flux *is* a total. The statistics live in three companions:

* **uncertainty of the total** — every rate carries `err_in`/`err_out`/`err_net`, the **sampling
  standard error of the cell-sum** (large when a few cells dominate); `bootstrap=N` adds percentile
  **confidence intervals** `ci_*` (see below).
* **angular breakdown** — [`fluxmap`](@ref) bins the shell by surface coordinate: `quantity=:vr` is the
  **mass-weighted mean** `v⊥` per (φ, cosθ/z) bin (km/s), while `quantity=:mdot` is the **per-bin sum**
  of the mass flux (M⊙/yr), whose total equals the budget's net.
* **per-cell distribution** — [`fluxshell`](@ref) returns the shell cells themselves, so you can take
  any statistic you like (`mean`/`median`/`std`/quantiles of `getvar(sh, :vr_sphere, :km_s)`, a phase
  diagram, …).

## Phase decomposition

Pass `phases` — a `NamedTuple` of shell→mask functions — for a per-phase breakdown in `.components`.
The phases sum exactly to the total (per quantity and per direction), so a paper can define its phases
once and trust the budget closes:

```julia
fb = fluxbudget(gas; surface=:sphere, radius=30.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc,
                phases = (cold = s -> getvar(s,:T,:K) .< 1e4,
                          hot  = s -> getvar(s,:T,:K) .>= 1e4))
fb.components.cold.mass.out      # cold-gas outflow rate
fb.components.hot.mass.out       # hot-gas outflow rate
# cold.out + hot.out == fb.rates.mass.out   (conservation across the partition)
```

## Off-axis surfaces (tilted cylinder, plane)

`fluxbudget` is a 3-D measurement, so the surface can be tilted. A **sphere** is orientation-free. A
**cylinder** can be aligned to an arbitrary `axis` — a 3-vector, or `:angmom` (the gas net angular
momentum `L = Σ m·h`, e.g. a galaxy's spin) — and a **`:plane`** surface measures the flux crossing a
plane normal to `axis` (disk in-/outflow):

!!! note "What `radius`/`shell_width` mean per surface"
    `radius` is the **location of the surface** and `shell_width` its thickness, but "location" depends
    on the geometry: for `:sphere` it is the spherical radius `R` (shell `|r|∈[R±Δr/2]`); for `:cylinder`
    the cylindrical radius (wall at `R_cyl∈[R±Δr/2]`); and for **`:plane` it is the signed along-axis
    offset** — the plane sits at `axis·r = R` (slab `∈[R±Δr/2]`), so `radius=5, axis=[0,0,1]` is a plane
    5 kpc *above* the midplane (use a negative `radius` for below, `radius=0` for the midplane). In each
    case `v⊥` is the velocity component along the surface normal (radial for sphere/cylinder, along
    `axis` for the plane).

```julia
# disk-edge flux in the angular-momentum frame
fb = fluxbudget(gas; surface=:cylinder, radius=15.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc, axis=:angmom)
# fountain/wind crossing a plane 5 kpc above the disk
fb = fluxbudget(gas; surface=:plane, radius=5.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc, axis=[0.,0.,1.])
```

The four surface choices, made concrete — each panel is the set of cells that `fluxbudget` integrates
over for that geometry, shown edge-on over the same disk galaxy (use [`fluxshell`](@ref) to extract and
visualize any of them):

![fluxbudget surface geometries (edge-on). *Sphere:* a spherical shell at radius R (its edge-on
projection fills a disk of radius R). *Cylinder:* the vertical wall at cylindrical radius R — the
disk-edge surface. *Plane:* a slab normal to the axis at along-axis position R (here R = 10 kpc above
the midplane) — for measuring a wind/fountain crossing a height. *Off-axis cylinder:* the same wall
tilted to an arbitrary `axis` (here `[0.5,0,1]`; use `axis=:angmom` to align with the disk
spin).](assets/features/flux_geometries.png)

Off-axis selection is **cell-centre based** (vs the axis-aligned path's cell-volume intersection), so it
differs by ~10–15 % for thin shells — prefer `shell_width` ≥ a couple of cells. A cylinder's vertical
extent defaults to `2·rout`; override with `height`.

## Bootstrap confidence intervals

Beyond the analytic standard error, pass `bootstrap=N` to attach **percentile confidence intervals**
(resampling the shell cells with replacement; reproducible via `bootstrap_seed`, level set by
`ci_level`, default 0.95):

```julia
fb = fluxbudget(gas; surface=:sphere, radius=30.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc, bootstrap=1000)
fb.rates.mass.net, fb.rates.mass.ci_net      # e.g. 0.03, (-1.94, 1.86) → consistent with balance
```

Each rate gains `ci_in`/`ci_out`/`ci_net` `(lo, hi)` (≈ NaN without bootstrap).

## Visualizing the shell

[`fluxshell`](@ref) returns the **exact thin shell** that `fluxbudget` measured, as an ordinary
`HydroDataType` — so you can *see what was measured*. Project it (it appears as a ring/annulus), or
map the surface-normal velocity to see *where* on the shell gas flows in (`< 0`) versus out (`> 0`):

```julia
sh = fluxshell(gas; surface=:sphere, radius=30.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc)

projection(sh, :sd, :Msol_pc2; center=[:bc])          # the shell as a ring/annulus
projection(sh, :vr_sphere, :km_s; center=[:bc])       # inflow (blue) / outflow (red) over the shell
# combine with a Makie backend to render the maps, or feed sh to profile/phase
```

![`fluxshell` makes the measured surface explicit. *Left:* the full gas of a disk galaxy, edge-on.
*Right:* the cells `fluxbudget` actually integrates over — the R = 10 kpc spherical shell (its edge-on
projection is a disk of radius 10 kpc, brightest where the shell cuts the dense midplane). The budget is
the flux of gas crossing exactly this surface.](assets/features/fluxshell.png)

`fluxshell` and `fluxbudget` use the identical selection, so the visualization is guaranteed to show
exactly the cells that entered the budget. `fluxshell` and `fluxmap` accept the same `axis`/`:angmom`
and `surface=:plane` options as `fluxbudget`, so off-axis surfaces can be visualized too (the tilted
`fluxmap` unrolls the cylinder about `n̂` as a (φ′, z′) map, and its `:mdot` map still sums to the
tilted budget).

### The surface map (`fluxmap`)

`projection` of the shell flattens it onto a Cartesian plane and **superposes** the near and far side.
For the true "where on the surface does gas flow in vs out" picture, [`fluxmap`](@ref) bins the shell
by **surface coordinates** — (φ, cosθ) for a sphere (an equal-solid-angle sky map), (φ, z) for a
cylinder (the wall unrolled) — so each cell sits at its own location, no superposition:

```julia
fm = fluxmap(gas; surface=:sphere, radius=30.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc, quantity=:vr)
fm.map        # nφ × ncosθ map of mean v⊥ [km/s] — heatmap it (red = outflow, blue = inflow)

fmd = fluxmap(gas; surface=:sphere, radius=30.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc, quantity=:mdot)
sum(fmd.map)  # == fluxbudget(...).rates.mass.net   — the surface map closes to the budget
```

`quantity=:vr` maps the mass-weighted mean normal velocity (inflow < 0, outflow > 0); `quantity=:mdot`
maps each bin's mass-flux contribution (Msol/yr), and its sum equals the net flux. `fluxmap` returns the
arrays; it is *not* `projection` — different axes, no LOS superposition.

![Inflow/outflow surface map of a spherical shell at R = 10 kpc around a disk galaxy (`fluxmap`,
`quantity=:vr`): the mass-weighted mean radial velocity over the (φ, cos θ) sky — blue is inflow,
red-brown is outflow. The patchy fountain (mixed in/out at every latitude) is the genuine angular
structure that a sum-into-a-single-number budget hides.](assets/features/fluxmap_skymap.png)

With a Makie backend loaded, [`fluxmapplot`](@ref) renders it directly (perceptually-uniform diverging
`:vik`, blue-in/red-out, symmetric range clipped at the `clip` percentile — default 0.95 — so a few
extreme cells don't wash out the contrast):

```julia
using CairoMakie
fig = fluxmapplot(fluxmap(gas; surface=:sphere, radius=30.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc))
Makie.save("flux_skymap.png", fig)
```

## Statistics: uncertainty and the radial profile

Two ways to improve the statistics of a flux measurement, both built in:

**More cells per shell** — a wider `shell_width` puts more cells in the sum (the standard
statistics-vs-localization tradeoff). Note `fluxbudget` does the **cell-by-cell sum** `Σ mᵢ·v_r,i`, which
captures the density–velocity correlation exactly — *not* `⟨ρ⟩·⟨v_r⟩` over the shell, which would lose
that correlation and bias the answer.

**Sampling uncertainty** — each rate carries `err_in`/`err_out`/`err_net`: the shot-noise standard error
of the cell-sum. It is large when a few cells dominate the flux (an under-resolved or sparsely-sampled
shell), so it tells you when a number is trustworthy:

```julia
fb = fluxbudget(gas; surface=:sphere, radius=30.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc)
fb.rates.mass.net, fb.rates.mass.err_net      # e.g. 0.03 ± 0.96  → consistent with balance
```

**Radial flux profile** — [`fluxprofile`](@ref) runs the budget across many radii at once, so you see
*where* the flux is launched or converges and can pick a converged radius/width:

```julia
fp = fluxprofile(gas; surface=:sphere, radii=5:5:50, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc)
fp.radius, fp.net, fp.err_net      # net Ṁ(R) ± sampling error [Msol/yr]
# e.g. net < 0 in the disk (inflow) → net > 0 in the halo (outflow); a huge err flags a bad shell
```

![Radial mass-flux profile (`fluxprofile`): inflow and outflow rates and the net (with its sampling
error band) versus radius. Both are large in the churning inner galaxy and converge to a small net at
large R; the wide band at small R flags the under-sampled inner shells.](assets/features/fluxprofile.png)

For the dominant snapshot-to-snapshot noise, time-average instead (see below).

## Time evolution

[`fluxtimeseries`](@ref) maps `fluxbudget` over a snapshot series and assembles the rate versus time —
the inflow/outflow history through a fixed surface:

```julia
loadfn = o -> gethydro(getinfo(o, "/sim"), verbose=false)
fts = fluxtimeseries(loadfn, 100:10:300, :sphere; radius=30.0, shell_width=2.0, range_unit=:kpc)
fts.t, fts.out, fts.in, fts.net      # time [Myr] and the rate history [Msol/yr]
```

## Definition & correctness

The estimator is intentionally explicit and recorded on the result (`surface`, `radius`, `shell_width`,
`center`) so the methodological choice is reproducible. The thin-shell estimator is verified against the
analytic surface integral `∮ ρ v⊥ dA = 4πR²ρv⊥` (it converges as `O((Δr/R)²)`), the inflow/outflow split
and `net = in + out` are exact, and the phase decomposition sums to the total — all guarded by the test
suite, in the same spirit as Mera's projection/covering-grid conservation oracles.
