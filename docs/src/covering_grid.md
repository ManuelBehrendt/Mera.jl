# Covering Grid / Fixed-Resolution Buffer

!!! tip "Run it yourself"
    This page is also an executable **Jupyter notebook** — [open / download `covering_grid.ipynb`](https://github.com/ManuelBehrendt/Notebooks/blob/master/Mera-Docs/version_1/covering_grid.ipynb). The notebooks run end-to-end and double as part of Mera's test suite.

[`covering_grid`](@ref) resamples the sparse AMR leaf cells onto a **dense, uniform `Nx×Ny×Nz`
array** at a chosen refinement level — every output cell sampled, *not* integrated (unlike
[`projection`](@ref), which sums along a line of sight). [`slice`](@ref) is the 2-D, single-cell-thick
version (a fixed-resolution buffer through a plane).

Use it to feed analyses that need a regular grid: power spectra, FFTs, structure functions, volume
rendering / VTK export, machine-learning inputs, or simple `array`-style indexing.

!!! note "Works on AMR cell data only"
    `covering_grid` and `slice` operate on the **AMR cell** datasets — hydro ([`gethydro`](@ref)),
    gravity ([`getgravity`](@ref)), and radiative transfer ([`getrt`](@ref)) — which carry cell
    indices and refinement levels. They are **not** defined for particles ([`getparticles`](@ref),
    which are point masses, not cells) or clumps; passing one raises a clear `MethodError`. To grid
    particles, deposit them with [`projection`](@ref) instead.

!!! warning "Size it first — a uniform grid can be far larger than the AMR data"
    AMR stores cells only where the simulation refined; a covering grid fills **every** cell at the
    target level. Resampling a sparsely-refined region to its finest level can blow up the cell count
    by orders of magnitude. Always estimate the size with [`covering_grid_memory`](@ref) before
    building — and `covering_grid` itself refuses to allocate past `max_bytes` (default 4 GB).

## Estimate the memory first

```julia
gas = gethydro(getinfo(output, path))            # e.g. AMR lmin 3 … lmax 7

covering_grid_memory(gas, [:rho, :T]; lmax=7)
# covering_grid memory estimate:
#   level 7  dims (128, 128, 128)  (2097152 cells × 2 var(s))
#   per array : 16.8 MB
#   result    : 33.6 MB
#   peak build: 50.3 MB
#   AMR cells : 590311   blow-up ×3.553
```

The returned `NamedTuple` has `dims`, `ncells`, `bytes_per_array`, `result_bytes`, `peak_bytes` (the
construction high-water mark — `nvars + 1` arrays, since one geometric weight grid is shared), and the
`blowup` factor (output cells ÷ AMR cells). Pass an `InfoType` to size a grid *before* even reading the
data (then the AMR-relative `blowup` is `missing`).

## Build the 3-D grid

```julia
cg = covering_grid(gas, [:rho, :T], [:nH, :K]; lmax=7)   # units optional (default: code units)
cg[:rho]                       # the 128×128×128 array, n_H in cm⁻³
cg.cellsize                    # physical cell size (pos_unit)
cg.extent                      # [x0,x1,y0,y1,z0,z1] (pos_unit)
```

Restrict to a sub-box (in any unit) and the grid is built only there — much cheaper:

```julia
cg = covering_grid(gas, :rho; lmax=10, center=[:bc],
                   xrange=[-2,2], yrange=[-2,2], zrange=[-1,1], range_unit=:kpc)
```

**Resampling rule (volume-conservative).** A leaf coarser than the target level is *replicated* to fill
the block of output cells it covers; leaves finer than the target are *volume-averaged* down. Because
the AMR leaves tile space, `Σ value·volume` is preserved exactly at any target level — `covering_grid`
of `:rho` conserves total mass whether you up- or down-sample. Output cells that fall outside the data
are `NaN`.

## 2-D slice (FRB)

```julia
sl = slice(gas, :rho, :nH; slice_axis=:z, slice_pos=0.5)   # mid-plane n_H cut
sl[:rho]                       # a 2-D array (single-cell-thick, non-integrated)
```

`slice_pos` is in `slice_unit` (`:standard` ⇒ a fraction of the box). The slice equals the
corresponding layer of the full covering grid, but only that layer is built. `slice_axis` may be
`:x`, `:y`, or `:z`; `grid[var]` is then a 2-D array. Note that `result.extent` keeps all six
bounds `[x0,x1,y0,y1,z0,z1]` (the collapsed axis spans one cell), so you always know where the slice
sits in 3-D.

## API

The functions ([`covering_grid`](@ref), [`covering_grid_memory`](@ref), [`slice`](@ref)) and the
result type [`CoveringGridResult`](@ref) are documented in the [API reference](api.md).
