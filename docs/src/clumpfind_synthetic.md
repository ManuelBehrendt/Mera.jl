# Clump Finding — a synthetic, ground-truth example

This page is a self-contained, **data-free** worked example for the structure finder
([`clumpfind`](@ref)). It builds a small Mera simulation *from scratch* — a real
`HydroDataType` + `PartDataType` on a self-consistent unit system, no RAMSES files — whose
clump population is **known exactly**. Because the ground truth is known, every finder and
every feature can be both *exercised* and *scored* (Adjusted Rand Index, completeness,
purity, recovered mass, virial state). The same field drives the accuracy test
`test/54_clumpfind_synthetic_tests.jl`, which runs in CI on every platform.

The generator lives in [`examples/synthetic_clumps.jl`](https://github.com/ManuelBehrendt/Mera.jl/blob/master/examples/synthetic_clumps.jl).

## Get the data

The generator is deterministic, so you can either **regenerate** the identical field
locally or **download** the prebuilt dataset (≈1.8 MB, LZ4-compressed Mera/JLD2).

```julia
using Mera
include(joinpath(pkgdir(Mera), "examples", "synthetic_clumps.jl"))

# Option A — regenerate the identical field locally (no download):
F = synthetic_clumps()
gas, particles, truth = F.gas, F.particles, F.truth

# Option B — download the prebuilt dataset once, then load it:
using Downloads
url = "https://github.com/ManuelBehrendt/Mera.jl/releases/download/synthetic-data-v1/mera_synthetic_clumps.jld2"
Downloads.download(url, "mera_synthetic_clumps.jld2")
D = load_synthetic_clumps("mera_synthetic_clumps.jld2")
gas, particles, truth = D.gas, D.particles, D.truth
```

The stored `gas` / `particles` are ordinary Mera data objects: every Mera verb
(`getvar`, `projection`, `clumpfind`, …) works on them unchanged. `save_synthetic_clumps(dir)`
writes the file yourself.

## The field

Eight clumps are injected into a `128³` grid in a 1 kpc box (Gaussian gas overdensities;
matching particle bags; plus a two-component kinematic stream for the phase-space finder):

* **A–E** — five isolated, self-gravitating (cold) clumps spanning ~2 dex in mass — the
  bread-and-butter case and the mass-function spectrum.
* **Fhot** — a massive but *kinematically hot* clump (σ = 28 km/s): spatially obvious yet
  **gravitationally unbound** — the boundedness/virial test case.
* **G1 + G2** — two cores sharing one envelope, ~0.1 kpc apart — the **deblending /
  substructure** test case that single-threshold friends-of-friends cannot split.

injected ground-truth clumps, coloured by id.*

## Run every finder and score it

`clump_recovery` compares a finder's per-cell labelling against the known truth labels:

```julia
ll, thr = 2.0/2^7, 5.0
P    = Mera._make_points(gas, :rho; threshold=thr, threshold_unit=:standard)
tlab = [F.true_label(P.x[i], P.y[i], P.z[i]) for i in eachindex(P.x)]

for fdr in (ThresholdFoF(:rho;     threshold=thr, linking_length=ll),
            DensityWatershed(:rho; threshold=thr, linking_length=ll, persistence=30.0),
            Dendrogram(:rho;       threshold=thr, linking_length=ll, min_delta=30.0),
            PersistenceFinder(:rho;threshold=thr, linking_length=ll, persistence=30.0))
    flab, _ = Mera._label(fdr, P)
    r = clump_recovery(flab, tlab)
    println(rpad(nameof(typeof(fdr)),18), "  ARI=", round(r.ari,digits=3),
            "  completeness=", round(r.completeness,digits=3), "  purity=", round(r.purity,digits=3))
end
```

| Finder             | clumps | ARI   | completeness | purity | notes |
|--------------------|:------:|:-----:|:------------:|:------:|-------|
| `ThresholdFoF`     |   7    | 0.892 |    1.00      | 0.859  | merges the G1+G2 pair |
| `DensityWatershed` |   8    | 0.936 |    1.00      | 0.925  | splits the pair along the saddle |
| `Dendrogram`       |   8    | 0.936 |    1.00      | 0.926  | + full merge tree (`hierarchy=true`) |
| `PersistenceFinder`|   8    | 0.936 |    1.00      | 0.926  | prominence-pruned peaks |
| `HDBSCANFinder`    |   7    | 0.892 |    1.00      | 0.859  | density-adaptive, no threshold tuning |

All finders recover the isolated clumps with completeness 1.0; the deblending finders
additionally resolve the touching pair, which is the only difference in their score.

## Deblending the touching pair

The red box marks G1+G2. `ThresholdFoF` connects them into one clump; the density-aware
finders split them along the saddle:

![Finder comparison](assets/clumpfind/finders_compare.png)

```julia
near(c) = 0.40 < c.com[1] < 0.62 && 0.45 < c.com[2] < 0.60 && 0.68 < c.com[3] < 0.82
count(near, clumpfind(gas, ThresholdFoF(:rho; threshold=thr, linking_length=ll)).clumps)        # 1
count(near, clumpfind(gas, DensityWatershed(:rho; threshold=thr, linking_length=ll, persistence=30.0)).clumps)  # 2

# the same two cores appear as bound substructure of the single FoF clump:
csub = clumpfind(gas, :rho; threshold=thr, linking_length=ll, substructure=true)
any(get(c, :n_subclumps, 0) == 2 for c in csub.clumps)   # true
```

## Accuracy, boundedness and the mass function

![Accuracy panel](assets/clumpfind/accuracy.png)

*Left: recovery metrics per finder. Centre: with `boundedness=true` the six cold clumps
land at `α_vir ≪ 1` (bound) while the hot clump Fhot sits at `α_vir ≈ 18` (unbound) — the
finder labels it `bound=false`. Right: the recovered cumulative clump mass function.*

```julia
cat = clumpfind(gas, ThresholdFoF(:rho; threshold=thr, linking_length=ll);
                boundedness=true, egrav=:tree)
# the validator chain turns the virial state into a filter — drop the unbound clump:
bound = clumpfind(gas, ThresholdFoF(:rho; threshold=thr, linking_length=ll);
                  validators=[Bound(:tree), VirialBelow(2.0)])
bound.nclumps == cat.nclumps - 1     # Fhot removed
```
