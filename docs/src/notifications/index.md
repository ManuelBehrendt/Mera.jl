Reliable notifications that reach you anyw## Core Functions Overview

All notification methods use the same core functions:e:
- Complete email setup guide (Gmail, Outlook, custom SMTP)
- Environment variable configuration
- Mobile-friendly notifications
- Best practices for research workflows

### [Zulip (Team Chat)](zulip.md)
Advanced team collaboration and organized research workflows:
- Zulip setup and bot configuration
- File attachments and rich content
- Progress tracking and timing
- Exception handling and error reporting
- Team organization strategies

## Which Method Should I Use?

### Use **Bell** when:tifications for research workflows, organized by notification method.

## Learning Path: Simple to Advanced

We'll learn notifications in pedagogical order, with each level building upon the previous one:

1. **[Bell (Local Audio)](bell.md)** - Start with simple audio feedback
2. **[Email](email.md)** - Add reliable remote notifications  
3. **[Zulip (Team Chat)](zulip.md)** - Build sophisticated research workflowsion System Documentation

A pedagogical guide to using Julia notifications for research workflows, organized by notification method.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Path: Simple to Advanced

We'll learn notifications in pedagogical order, with each level building upon the previous one:

1. **ï¿½ [Bell (Local Audio)](bell.md)** - Start with simple audio feedback
2. **ðŸ“§ [Email](email.md)** - Add reliable remote notifications  
3. **ðŸ’¬ [Zulip (Team Chat)](zulip.md)** - Build sophisticated research workflows

Each level gives you progressively more powerful ways to manage your research.

## Quick Test - Try It Now!

Want to test notifications immediately? Start with these one-liners:

```julia
using Mera

# 1. Simple beep (works immediately)
bell()

# 2. Email notification (if you have email configured)
notifyme("My first notification!")

# 3. Zulip team notification (if you have Zulip configured)
notifyme("Team update!", zulip_channel="general")
```

> ðŸ’¡ **First time?** The `bell()` function works immediately. Email and Zulip require setup (covered in their respective sections).

## Installation

The notification system is part of the Mera.jl package:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Mera")

using Mera
notifyme("Installation successful! ðŸŽ‰")
```

## ï¿½ Core Functions Overview

All notification methods use the same core functions:

```julia
# Basic notification
notifyme(message; email=nothing, zulip_channel=nothing, ...)

# Timed execution with notification
result = timed_notify(description) do
    # Your code here
end

# Safe execution with error handling
result = safe_execute(description) do
    # Your code here  
end

# Progress tracking
tracker = create_progress_tracker(total_items, task_name="My Task")
update_progress!(tracker, current_item)
complete_progress!(tracker, "Finished!")
```
