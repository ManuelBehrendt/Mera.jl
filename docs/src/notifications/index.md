# Notifications System

![Team Collaboration with MERA.jl Notifications](assets/representative_team_60.png)

*MERA.jl's notification system enables seamless team collaboration and progress sharing across distributed astrophysics research workflows*

**Stay connected to your research computations anywhere, anytime.**

The MERA notifications system transforms how you monitor long-running simulations, coordinate with research teams, and track computational workflows. Whether you're analyzing galaxy formation over hours or running parameter sweeps overnight, stay informed with intelligent notifications that understand your research needs.

## Key Features

**üìß Smart Email Integration** - Simple setup with system mail integration  
**üí¨ Advanced Zulip Support** - Rich team messaging with organized conversations  
**üìé File Attachments** - Automatic plot sharing, data files, and results  
**‚è±Ô∏è Execution Tracking** - Built-in timing with progress monitoring  
**üö® Exception Handling** - Intelligent error reporting with stack traces  
**üñ•Ô∏è Cross-Platform** - Full support for macOS, Linux, and Windows (Windows support not tested)  
**üî¨ Research-Optimized** - Designed for scientific computing workflows

## Quick Start

**‚ö†Ô∏è Setup Required First**: Notifications require configuration files in your home directory:
- `~/email.txt` - For email notifications
- `~/zulip.txt` - For Zulip team messaging  
- No config = No notifications sent (silent)

```julia
# Setup email notifications (run once)
# Create ~/email.txt with your email address
open(homedir() * "/email.txt", "w") do f
    write(f, "your.email@example.com")
end

# Basic notification (email if configured, silent otherwise)
notifyme("Analysis complete!")

# Audio notification (always works, no setup needed)
bell()  # Plays local sound

# After Zulip setup: Share results with team  
notifyme("Temperature study finished!", 
         zulip_channel="research", 
         image_path="temperature_plot.png")

# Monitor long computations with timing
start_time = time()
# ... heavy computation ...
notifyme("Simulation done!", start_time=start_time)
```

**What gets sent:**
- ‚úÖ **Email only**: If only `~/email.txt` exists
- ‚úÖ **Zulip only**: If only `~/zulip.txt` exists  
- ‚úÖ **Both email AND Zulip**: If both config files exist (sends to ALL configured methods)
- ‚ùå **Nothing**: If no config files (function runs silently)

**üìù Note**: `notifyme()` always sends to ALL configured notification methods. There's no way to choose email OR Zulip for individual notifications - it sends to both if both are set up.

## Why Use MERA Notifications?

### Traditional Approach
```julia
# Manual checking every few hours
run_simulation()  # Hope it doesn't crash overnight
```

### MERA Approach  
```julia
# Intelligent monitoring
timed_notify("Galaxy formation simulation") do
    run_simulation()
end
# ‚úÖ Get success notification with timing
# ‚ùå Get error notification with diagnostics
# üìä Get progress updates automatically
```
